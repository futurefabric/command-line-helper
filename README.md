Command line helper
===================

A bunch of useful CL commands.
(well, ones I find useful anyway).

You can [preview this on Github Pages](http://futurefabric.github.io/command-line-helper).

Clone, open index.html in your browser.

Provided as is.
Obviously be careful in your command line â€” if you don't know what something does, *don't do it*
